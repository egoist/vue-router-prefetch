## Features

- Prefetch links when they are visible in viewport.
- You don't need to change your code base to make it work.
- Tiny-size.

## Install

```bash
yarn add vue-router-prefetch
```

If you're using Vue 2, you should install `vue-router-prefetch@1` instead.

## Usage

You need to use this plugin after `vue-router`:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { createRouter } from 'vue-router'
import RouterPrefetch from 'vue-router-prefetch'

const app = createApp()
const router = createRouter()
app.use(router)
app.use(RouterPrefetch)
```

Then you can use `<router-link>` without any changes, when this component is visible in viewport, it will automatically prefetch the (async) route component.

**Check out the [live demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vue-nr9q5u).**

You can also register it as a new component instead of overriding `<router-link>`:

```js
app.use(RouterPrefetch, {
  componentName: 'QuickLink'
})
```

Now you can use it as `<quick-link>` in your app.

## Browser Support

- Without polyfills: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Android Browser, Samsung Internet.
- With [Intersection Observer polyfill](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/tree/master/polyfill) ~6KB gzipped/minified: Safari, IE11

## Props

All [props](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#router-link-props) of `<router-link>` are still available, additional props are listed below.

### prefetch

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `true`

Whether to prefetch the matched route component.

You can also set `meta.prefetch` on vue-router's `route` object to disable prefetching this route for all `<router-link>`s:

```js
createRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/some-async-page',
      meta: { prefetch: false },
      component: () => import('./async-page.vue')
    }
  ]
})
```

It's also possible to turn of prefetching globally:

```js
app.use(RouterPrefetch, {
  prefetch: false
})
```

### prefetchFiles

- Type: `string[]`
- Examples: `['/foo.css']`

A list of additional files to prefetch. By default we only prefetch the route component.

You can also set `meta.prefetchFiles` on vue-router's `route` object, it will be merged with the prop value:

```js
createRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/some-async-page',
      meta: { prefetchFiles: ['/foo.css'] },
      component: () => import('./async-page.vue')
    }
  ]
})
```

### timeout

- Type: `number`
- Default: `2000` (ms)

Timeout after which prefetching will occur.
